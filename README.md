# Molecular Simulation - Introduction

This is a collection of documents describing selected introductory topics in molecular simulation.
They were initiated by converting to LaTeX the MSWord files that are used as part of the course *CE 530 Molecular Simulation*, taught at the University at Buffalo (http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/~kofke/ce530/)

Contributions and suggestions are welcome; the hope is that with work and contributions from the community this can ultimately serve as a valuable community resource that will be of use in a range of courses.

## Layout and contents
Currently this repository consists of source materials (LaTeX and figures) as well as final PDF files of the different components.

## Table of Contents

(Links here go to the LaTeX source but are followed by a link to the PDF)
- [Physical quantities in molecular simulation](HardSphereMD.tex) [(PDF)](HardSphereMD.pdf): Deals with the types of quantities encountered in molecular simulations, as well as units, dimensions, and scaling.
- [Hard sphere molecular dynamics (MD)](HardSphereMD.tex) [(PDF)](HardSphereMD.pdf): Introduces the concepts and methods needed to perform molecular dynamics simulations of hard spheres to introduce some basic concepts via familiar mechanics.
- [A lightning introduction to statistical mechanics](StatMech6c.tex) [(PDF)](StatMech6c.pdf): Gives a brief introduction to statistical mechanics as it relates to our subject material.
